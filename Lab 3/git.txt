	GIT COMMANDS

1. Install Git:
	To install git in linux, just type the following command in the terminal {sudo apt-get install git}.
	And for windows you can download it from git-scm site.

Instead of making different files for different changes we can store them as different versions of a single file.
Git is used to track how many versions of a file have been made so far and what are the changes that have been made.
 Git is a version management system and github is cloud storage.
