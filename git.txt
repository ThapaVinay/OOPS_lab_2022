1. Install Git:
	To install git in linux, just type the following command in the terminal {sudo apt-get install git}.
	And for windows you can download it from git-scm site.

Instead of making different files for different changes we can store them as different versions of a single file.
Git is used to track how many versions of a file have been made so far and what are the changes that have been made.
 Git is a version management system and github is cloud storage.
 remote -> somewhere else, somewhere far.

2. To initialise git ->

	And to remove git -> rm -rf .git

3. To add to the staging area ->
	git add.
	
4. To commit changes and make a local repository-> 
	git commit -m "Message"

5. To see the changes made -> 	
	git diff -> it gives us the difference between the staged file and the changes done right now.
	git diff --staged -> it gives the differences between the committed file and the file in the staged 			
	area.

6. To make new branch ->
	git brach branch1

7. To switch to diffrent branch ->
	git checkout branh1
